# Web-Design_Challenge

This repository creates a visualization dashboard website using visualizations 
created in a past repository (WeatherPy in the Python-API-Challenge). 
Individual pages for each plot have been created along with a means by which we can 
navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. 
There is also a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another 
page where we can view the data used to build the vizualizations.

This folder contains:

1. A resources folder that contains the cities.csv file.

2. An images folder that contains the four visualization plots from the analysis.

3. Seven HTML files that constitute the entire dashboard content.

4. A styles.css file that contains additional styling to the website, including image centering, navbar 
background color, media queries, color changes on hover, etc.

5. A Jupyter notebook called data-to-html.ipynb that was used to read the CSV file into a dataframe and 
convert that into an HTML table to use in the website.
